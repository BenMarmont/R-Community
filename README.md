# R-Community
The repository is a collection of the gists used by speakers to demonstrate their work and functionality in R our members might be unaware of. A gist is a small set of example code.

The data in these gists is public and therefore you are free to use the example to get your head around their code.

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, treat this repository as a website and navigate the files to find the code/date you need. You can then download it and run it locally.
